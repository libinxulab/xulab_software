## toxccs

This Python package is intended to automate the extraction and processing of LC-IM-MS/MS data for building multi-dimensional reference databases. The current version of `toxccs` interfaces directly with Waters .raw data and extracts both chromatographic and mobility information for manual review. For Please note that the `dhrmasslynxapi` package containing the original Waters sdk files, copied into the `sdk\` directory, are required to utilize the `toxccs` package and its sub-packages. The sdk files may be obtained from the lab NAS (under `lab_resources/masslynx_sdk_files/`):

* `cdt.dll`
* `MassLynxLockMassProcessor.py`
* `MassLynxRaw.dll`
* `MassLynxRaw.lib`
* `MassLynxRawChromatogramReader.py`
* `MassLynxRawDefs.py`
* `MassLynxRawInfoReader.py`
* `MassLynxRawReader.py`
* `MassLynxRawScanReader.py`
* `MassLynxSampleList.py`

The `dhrmasslynxapi` is located under xulab_software/imms and may be copied directly into the root directory. 

## `Directory Structure`
The root directory should contain the following Python files and folders:
* `dhrmasslynxapi` 
    * ensure that all files listed above are copied into the sdk\ directory
 * `toxccs`
* `Waters .raw files`
	* it is recommended to copy all required .raw files into the root directory from an external hard drive
* `Input .xlsx files` (described below)

## `toxccs.extract`
This module defines the RawProcessor object for extracting chromatographic and mobility information from Waters .raw files. Note that this module is intended to handle simple ion mobility profiles, where all peaks are fit to a single Gaussian function. If your mobility data are displaying more complex behavior, such as multiple peaks arising from protomers or constitutional isomers, it is highly recommended to use the `toxccs.multi_extract` module defined below.

### Dependencies
1. `pandas`
2. `numpy`
3. `scipy == 1.10.0`
5. `matplotlib`
6. `os`
7. `dhymasslynxapi.reader` and `dhrmasslynxapi.ccs_calibration`

### Initialization
The `RawProcessor` object is initialized with the path to an Excel file (.xlsx), which contains the list of target m/z values and associated experimental metadata:

```python
from toxccs.extract import RawProcessor

# initialize RawProcessor object 
data = RawProcessor("path/to/target/list.xlsx")
```
In the current version of `toxccs`, the target list should contain the following headers and information:

| File Name | Compound Name | SMILES                | Adduct | Target m/z | Sample Type | CCS Calibrant | Gradient     | Column Type |  
| ----------|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| file1.raw | Acetaminophen | CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(C=C1)O | [M+H]+ | 152.0708   | sample      | polyala       | develop_100B | Kinetex_C18 |
| file2.raw | Acetaminophen | CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(C=C1)O | [M-H]- | 150.0563   | sample      | polyala       | develop_100B | Kinetex_C18 |

1. **File Name**: (REQUIRED) path to the Waters .raw files to be processed
2. **Compound Name**: (REQUIRED) name of the target compound to be processed 
3. **SMILES** (OPTIONAL) SMILES string of the target compound to be processed
4. **Adduct** (REQUIRED) adduct type (i.e., [M+H]+, [M-H]-, etc.) of the target compound to be processed
5. **Target m/z**: (REQUIRED) theoretical m/z value of the target compound to be processed
6. **Sample Type**: (REQUIRED) indicate the sample type being processed (i.e., experimental "control," "sample," or  internal standard "IS")
7. **CCS Calibrant**: (REQUIRED) indicate the type of CCS calibrant used (i.e., "polyala," "drugs," "agilent," etc.)
8. **Gradient**: (REQUIRED) indicate the type of LC gradient used
9. **Columm Type**: (REQUIRED) indicate the type of LC column used

A template spreadsheet for creating the target m/z list is provided within this repository for convenience.

In addition to the required target m/z list, the `RawProcessor` object may also be initialized with the path to an optional Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheet containing reference retention times and CCS values for internal standards or quality control compounds:

```python
from toxccs.extract import RawProcessor

# initialize RawProcessor object with additional reference retention time and CCS list for quality control purposes
data = RawProcessor("path/to/target/list.xlsx", "optional/path/to/reference/list.xlsx")
```
If included, the reference list **must** contain the following headers:

| Exact m/z | Internal Standard | Gradient     | Reference Retention Time (min) | Reference CCS (Å²) |        
| ----------|:-----------------:|:------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------:|
| 107.1234  | IS_1              | develop_100B | 10.02                          | 179.4              | 
| 207.1234  | IS_2              | develop_100B | 11.57                          | 189.76             |
